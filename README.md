# Inference and Fine-Tuning Labs

This repo contains a few brief examples of working with Generative AI Models. 

1. llm

    The `llm` project has examples of finetuning LLMs with QLoRA and a few useful scripts for inference

2. image-generation

    The `image-generation` project has a very simple example of using a `stable-diffusion` model for generating images from text. 

To use these projects, make sure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the respective requirements file to install all of the necessary dependencies.
