# Large Language Model Practice

The `llm` project has examples of finetuning LLMs with QLoRA and a few useful scripts for inference along with interactive jupyter notebooks.

1. `finetuning` 
    This contains notebooks and scripts for finetuning large language models.  Change the behavior of pre-trained large language models using QLoRA finetuning methods.
